<p class='c009'>I will drop the mask and tell you the secret of my verses.
You say they impress you as being uneven and unfinished. I
heartily agree with you. As I have stated in my announcement
to the public, a poem of the scope and range of “My Rubaiyat”
is never complete. No doubt, it will undergo many changes
within the next ten years. I say ten years deliberately. You
see, I possess the arrogance of conviction. I believe it will
survive, simply because it strikes a popular chord, and attempts,
no matter how vaguely, to reproduce a broken melody that hums
in every mind. Somebody else may venture forth on similar
paths and succeed to please even the fastidious in rhyme. “My
Rubaiyat” may be put on the back shelves. Well, we will see.
I look at my work with objective eyes. It is a mere youngster
now. It will grow and nobody will watch its growth with keener
appreciation than I myself. The number of verses will not increase,
but I sincerely hope that they will gain in clarity and
strength as well as in musical and pictorial wealth of expression.</p>

<p class='c009'>As for versification, let me make this explanation. I chose the
eight syllable stanza on account of its terseness of expression. It
is least pliable to any rush and swing of rhythm, but most conducive
to the conveyance of fragmentary moods and thoughts.
The omission of rhyme I essayed for no other reason than its
technical difficulty. To make rhymeless lines read like a poem
is the most laborious task a songsmith can set himself. It is the
vanity of the alien to show his mastery over a language that was
neither his father’s nor his mother’s tongue. But I object to
your statement that I disdain rhythm. I have a vague suspicion
that you really mean meter. My meter is rough and wilful and
subject to impurities, as for instance counting the last two syllables
in words like “happier” and “sunnier” either as one or two,
just as my fancy, or rather my appreciation of rhythm, dictates.
My rhythm changes constantly but it is palpable, underneath as
it were, at all times. I have some experience as a reader (though
elocutionists may shrug their shoulders at my style of interpretation—let
them shrug) and I have, whenever I write, the habit of
reading aloud the words as I put them down. Reading means to
get a certain sense and swing, color and sound in the words as
one utters them. If my verses contain this possibility of aural
gratification they cannot be utterly devoid of rhythm. No doubt
my sense of sound alliteration is foreign, unconsciously Oriental.
I feel a sound relation, no, even a rhyme suggestion in
words like “chance” and “spring,” “herd” and “feet” at the end
of succeeding stanzas. The alliteration of Japanese poets
is much subtler (due to the peculiarities of the language) than
the word music of our Laniers and Whitmans, although it is
never conducted with the elaborate precision of a Poe or Swinburne.
It always remains fragmentary, it rarely resembles full
orchestration. Also my lines lack the merit of contrapuntal
structure. Yet they have one quality which is generally overlooked.
They possess pictorial harmony. My long and persistent
association with art makes me not only see but think things in
pictures. Pictures abound throughout “My Rubaiyat” for all
who have the mental pictorial vision to see them. Lines like “turn
phantoms with the colder morn” and “in a hilltown among
roses” are as concentrated as any image that can be found in a
<i>tanka</i> (i.e. Japanese short poem).</p>

<p class='c009'>Critics may contend that pictorial suggestion <i>per se</i>, as the
main characteristic of a poem, does not conform to the accepted
forms of poetry. This objection is meaningless to me. Without
the spirit of innovation there would have been no incentive to
write the poem. Like the composers of the day I believe in
the old ideals but in new methods of expression.</p>

<p class='c009'>My ambition was to write a simple poem which would appeal
to all; to chambermaids as well as cognoscenti, ordinary business
men as well as solitary artistic souls. Who will decide
whether I have succeeded or failed? Only the public at large.
The poem, no doubt, is too didactic for fragile aesthetics who
glorify naught but evanescent words, but it is surely no shortcoming
to try to express thought. Even exponents of the modern
schools attempt this—occasionally. The way of expression
is a different matter. It is open to criticism. But excuses that
a critic knows nothing about a certain subject, and yet at the
same time deliberate pricks at this very thorn in the flesh of his
ignorance are sad to contemplate. Rhyme is surely out of date.
And the supposed lack of rhythm is merely imaginary. Would
you enjoy Japanese or Chinese music? Very likely not and yet
they contain as fine a rhythm and as musical a quality as any
modern composition. Only they are vaguer, subtle, different.</p>

<p class='c009'>And on this difference hinges all logical and evasive argument.
The practical philosophy contained in “My Rubaiyat,” of
course, can be attacked for being non-moral or non-religious,
but the technique of the poem can be discussed only from one
viewpoint.</p>
<p class='c010'>Sincerely yours,</p>
